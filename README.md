# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This application allows the user to use an in-browser text-editor. By default the editor displays a header, but this can be deleted with any changes to content being saved between sessions. If all content is deleted then content will return to the default header on reload. The application can also be installed as an app on the computer by pressing the button on the top left, after which it can be used even when offline.
